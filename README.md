The repository contains code and results obtained while researching variants of the Russian language.

Project Description:
The project aims to investigate and analyze the phonological features and variations present in different dialects of the Russian language. By utilizing audio recordings from corpora representing various Russian dialects, the project seeks to uncover patterns, differences, and similarities in the pronunciation of phonemes and other speech characteristics across these dialects.

The project will begin by gathering a comprehensive collection of audio corpora, specifically focusing on non-standard variants of the Russian language. These corpora will include recordings from different regions and communities, each representing a unique dialect. The project will employ various computational methods and algorithms to facilitate the study. These may include techniques like dynamic time warping (DTW) for aligning and comparing speech sequences, sound clustering algorithms for grouping similar phonetic patterns, and statistical measures to quantify the degree of phonological variation within and between dialects.

Additionally, the project will investigate the influence of geographic distances on phonological variations by conducting analyses, such as Mantel tests. These tests will assess the correlation between average clustering values of phonetic patterns and geographic distance matrices. The interpretation of the results will shed light on the potential relationship between dialectal variations and geographical proximity.

Overall, this project seeks to deepen our knowledge of phonological variations in Russian dialects through a systematic analysis of audio corpora. By unraveling the intricacies of dialectal speech patterns, it aims to provide valuable insights into the diverse linguistic landscape of the Russian language.
