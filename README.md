# sound_distance
The repository contains code and results obtained while researching variants of the Russian language.

Project Description:
The project is devoted to applying audio clustering algorithms, particularly hierarchical clustering using dynamic timeline transformation (DTW), to dialect speech corpora. The work aims to analyze the variability of dialect speech (on the example of oral corpora). The analysis is focused on five frequently used monosyllabic words in Russian. In addition, the study examines potential correlations between clustering distances and geographic distances using the Mantel test. The data obtained give an idea of the clustering of non-standard variants of the Russian language and show the degree of influence of geographic proximity on the clustering results. The study contributes to understanding dialect variations and phonological features in the context of the Russian language.
